      <p class="mt-4">Great Vacation Adventures & Travel was started in 2016 by Avni Shah. She had the belief that other travelers would want to share the experiences and authentic adventures of travel, in a responsible and sustainable way. Back then it was just a one-man show, and now it has grown to a company. Originally just a few trips around Kenya, there is now hundreds of trips on offer around the East African region! Since its first days, there have now been over 5,000 travelers who have seen new sights, gained new experiences, and made new friends. While things may have changed a bit over that time, the core values are the same; Authentic experiences and sustainable travel.</p>
